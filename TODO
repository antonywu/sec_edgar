Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Failed to parse IBM, HPQ, ADI, LPSN (base multiplier)
* Failed to parse CSCO, NVDA (balance sheet)
* Failed to parse CRM, ORCL (income statement)
* Failed to parse TXN (traverse for table)

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Use different exception types so that we can rescue more specifically
* Make get_all_10k's to just ignore reports it can't parse?
* Introduce a confidence measure.  I.e., how do the balance sheet classifiers 
  look?  How stable are the financials off of which we're anchoring (e.g., ATO, 
  PM, etc.)?
* Automate the forecast
* Jettison 10q/10k #merge  (?)

Test Quality/Coverage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Increase the number of companies/years tested in balance sheet specs
* Revisit the shared financial statement speces.  Get rid of them?

Code Quality
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Think through whether merge should use original year's reported values, or 
  their possible restatement in later years
* Shift some calculations from QuarterlyReport to FinancialStatementSummary, so 
  that they'll be accurate post-merge
* DRY up the parser in QuarterlyReport.  ugh.
* Refactor a common parent class for the asset/liab/equity classifiers

Packaging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Update README with real example
