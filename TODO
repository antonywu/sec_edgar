Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* not able to handle reports that are in the exhibits
* not able to handle much variation...

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Introduce a confidence measure.  I.e., how do the balance sheet classifiers 
  look?  How stable are the financials off of which we're anchoring (e.g., ATO, 
  PM, etc.)?
* Automate the forecasting

Test Quality/Coverage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Increase the number of companies/years tested in balance sheet specs
* Revisit the shared financial statement specs.  Get rid of them?
* Use metaprogramming to periodically change the tests to use a different set of
  companies

Code Quality
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Think through whether merge should use original year's reported values, or 
  their possible restatement in later years
* Shift some calculations from QuarterlyReport to FinancialStatementSummary, so 
  that they'll be accurate post-merge
* Refactor a common parent class for the asset/liab/equity classifiers
