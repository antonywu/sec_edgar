sec_edgar is a gem that can download financial statements from the SEC/Edgar 
database, parse them, write them to CSV, and even merge across quarters/years.

Downloading, parsing, and writing to CSV all work well.  Merging across 
years/quarters is still a bit buggy and under development.

An example:

        require 'rubygems'
        require 'sec_edgar'
        
        @ticker = 'GOOG'
        @download_path = '/tmp/'
        
        # get all the quarterly reports for Google
        @edgar = SecEdgar::Edgar.new
        exit if not @edgar.good_ticker?(@ticker)
        @list_of_files = @edgar.download_10q_reports(@ticker, @download_path)
        
        # load first balance sheet
        @tenq = SecEdgar::QuarterlyReport.new
        @tenq.parse(@list_of_files[0])
        @tenq.normalize
        
        # load second balance sheet
        @tenq2 = SecEdgar::QuarterlyReport.new
        @tenq2.parse(@list_of_files[1])
        @tenq2.normalize
        
        # merge and write
        @fin_stmt = @tenq.bal_sheet
        @fin_stmt2 = @tenq2.bal_sheet
        @fin_stmt.merge(@fin_stmt2)
        @fin_stmt.write_to_csv("merged.csv")
